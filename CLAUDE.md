# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Status

This is a newly initialized Git repository with no existing codebase. The directory is currently empty except for the `.git` folder and this CLAUDE.md file.

## Development Setup

Since this is an empty repository, the specific development setup will depend on what type of project is created here. Common next steps might include:

- Adding a programming language-specific configuration file (package.json for Node.js, Cargo.toml for Rust, requirements.txt for Python, etc.)
- Setting up a basic project structure
- Configuring build tools, linters, and testing frameworks

## Git Workflow

The repository has been initialized with `git init`. To start pushing code:

1. Add files: `git add .`
2. Create initial commit: `git commit -m "Initial commit"`
3. Add remote repository: `git remote add origin <remote-url>`
4. Push to remote: `git push -u origin main`

## Notes for Future Development

This repository is ready for initial project setup. Future instances of Claude Code should help establish:

- Project type and language selection
- Directory structure and file organization
- Development tooling and configuration
- Testing and deployment workflows
